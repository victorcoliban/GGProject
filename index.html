                <p> 
                    Cocker Spaniels are dogs belonging to two breeds of the spaniel dog type: the American Cocker Spaniel and the English Cocker Spaniel,
                    both of which are commonly called simply Cocker Spaniel in their countries of origin. In the early 20th century, Cocker Spaniels also included 
                    small hunting spaniels.<a href="#"> See more...</a>

                <p>
                    Bassets are large, short, solid and long, with curved sabre tails held high over their long backs. An adult dog weighs between 20 and 35 kilograms (44 and 77 lb).
                    This breed, relative to its size, is heavier-boned than any other.

                <p>
                    This breed, like its ancestor the Bloodhound, has a hanging skin structure, which causes the face to tend to have a sad look;<a href="#"> See more...</a>

                <p>
                    The Black Golden Retriever is a medium-large gun dog that was bred to retrieve shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland game birds, during hunting and shooting parties.
                    The name "retriever" refers to the breed's ability to retrieve shot game undamaged due to their soft mouth. Golden retrievers have an instinctive love of water, 
                    and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards.<a href="#"> See more...</a>

                <p>
                    The origin of the beagle is not known. In the 11th century, William the Conqueror brought the St. Hubert Hound and the Talbot hound to Britain. In Britain
                    both of these strains were then crossed with Greyhounds to give them speed and stamina for deer hunting.<a href="#"> See more...</a>

                <p>
                    German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs. The breed standard height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for males, and 55–60 cm (22–24 in) for 
                    females. German Shepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to 8+1⁄2. The AKC official breed standard does not set a 
                    standard weight range.<a href="#"> See more...</a>
